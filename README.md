# Retail-Price-Optimization

Pricing a product is a crucial aspect in any business. Alot of thought process is out into it. There are different strategies to price different kinds of products. There are products whose sales are quite sensitive to their prices and as such a small change in their price can lead to noticeable change in their sales. While there are products whose sales are not much affected by their price - these tend to be either luxury items or necessities (like certain medicines). This notebook will focus on the former type of products.

Price elasticity of demand (Epd), or elasticity, is the degree to which the effective desire for something changes as its price changes. In general, people desire things less as those things become more expensive. However, for some products, the customer's desire could drop sharply even with a little price increase, and for other products, it could stay almost the same even with a big price increase. Economists use the term elasticity to denote this sensitivity to price increases. More precisely, price elasticity gives the percentage change in quantity demanded when there is a one percent increase in price, holding everything else constant.

Mathematically speaking, the price elasticity of demand is defined to be the percentage change in quantity demanded, q,divided by the percentage change in price, p.

The formula for calculating the Price Elasticity of Demand (Epd):

In this analysis, we'll examine the sales data for various items sold at a café, including burgers, Coke, lemonade, and coffee. Our objective as data scientists is to determine the optimal pricing for these items. If prices are set too high, sales may decline; if prices are too low, profit margins will shrink. Our goal is to identify the ideal price point that maximizes profit.

# Analysis Results

This analysis represents the price the café should set for its items to achieve maximum profit, based on past sales data. It's important to note that these recommendations apply to a typical day. On special occasions, such as holidays or events, customer buying behavior tends to shift, often resulting in increased consumption. These scenarios should be analyzed separately. Additionally, it’s crucial to exclude any external factors unrelated to price, such as data points from periods when items were discounted, as these could skew the analysis.

After implementing the new prices, it's essential to continuously track sales and profit. If this pricing strategy is integrated into a product, a dashboard can be developed to monitor these items and measure the resulting profit increase.
